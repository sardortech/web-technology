# JavaScript > Nav

I have made a navigation panel that contains with pages and resturant name. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that it is seen a little bit but you will see well as long as you scroll down or up the page. Yet if it is stayed the main, the view of this will aslo decrease, particularly, the name colors will turn to the main color, and navigation color will be disappeared. So for achieving this I have used JavaScript.
